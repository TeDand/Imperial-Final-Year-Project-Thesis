\chapter{Ethical, Legal and Safety Plan} \label{chap:ethical_plan}

In general the project in unproblematic, and poses minimal safety risks other than the ones presented when working with computers for extended periods of time (e.g., RSI, eye-strain, back aches etc.). In terms of ethical and legal considerations, however, it is important to make sure to use the practical camera setup in a sound manner. When collecting data from others it is important to be mindful of privacy issues. Consent must be taken from any participants if ever the need arises to take videos of others, but for the vast majority of project only videos of myself will be taken. As well as this it is important to consider where the system may be used if it is every put into production. Especially in IoT applications, privacy is of utmost concern, luckily with spiking data, if an intermediate video reconstruction cannot be obtained from the system, very little information can be discerned from spiking data. Therefore it would be very difficult to identify any individual within neuromorphic data itself.
