\chapter{Introduction}
% The introduction should set the scene and give a high-level problem statement/specification, so that after 
% reading the introduction the reader understands
% roughly what the problem is and what you intend to 
% do about it. Is the idea to write software, or develop 
% an algorithm, or produce hardware, or something 
% else?
% You should then highlight and summarise the most 
% interesting or important questions or problems that 
% your project addresses, and the broader context in 
% which those questions or problems are situated.
% Finally, you must briefly introduce the structure of 
% report (what you will cover in which chapters and how 
% these relate to each other). You donâ€™t need to go into 
% any detail, the aim is to make sure the reader has an 
% idea about what will be discussed and in what order.
