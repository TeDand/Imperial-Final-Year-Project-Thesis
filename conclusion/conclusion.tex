\color{red} TODO: Write out the following:

\begin{itemize}
    \item work with higher ram system to use whole of DVS128 dataset and run with higher batch sizes
    \item work with more datasets
    \item look at the use of nlp
    \item create more robust spiking neural networks
    \item test performance based on asynchronous and asynchronous frame-integration
    \item test performance of difference number of integrated frames
    \item evaluate the performance of more complex/pre-trained networks
\end{itemize}
