\section{Requirements Capture}

% Projects with a deliverable that serves a specific 
% function often have an initial phase in which expected 
% use is investigated and a brief more detailed than the 
% specification is constructed. This would include what 
% is necessary, what is desirable, etc in the final 
% deliverable. The results of requirements capture 
% determine project objectives and are used to inform 
% project evaluation.
% Requirements capture is important in all projects with 
% real-world deliverables, and is often a significant 
% amount of work in software projects. Where 
% requirements capture is less relevant (for example in
% an analytical ‘research-style’ project) this may be 
% replaced by a detailed description of the project aims 
% and objectives in the Introduction or the Background 
% sections.

\section{Two-phase Intensity Reconstruction Models}

In order to make use of existing highly-tested and documented computer vision techniques, intensity reconstruction models were first applied to events.
